## Code files description


+ **main.py**
  This file contains the app main logic. 
  It is a Python code which defines a Flask web application that allows users to authenticate with their Google account and interact with Google Drive.The file imports necessary libraries for Flask, Google OAuth, and Google Drive API integration. It sets up a secret key for session management and specifies the permissions required to access Google Drive. Main.py includes helper functions for managing OAuth tokens, refreshing them when expired, and logging requests and responses for debugging purposes. Basic error handling is also in place, particularly for server errors, which are logged and returned as a 500 error response.

+ **Sign-Up and Login Scripts:**
    You'll find the Sign-up and Login scripts in the logic folder.
    The JavaScript code handles user authentication using Firebase for both sign-up and login pages.
    In the sign-up process, users can create an account with their email and password. If successful, the user is shown a success message and redirected to the login page. If thereâ€™s an error, the user sees a corresponding error message (e.g., "No user found").
    In the login process, users enter their email and password. If successful, the user is logged in and redirected to the file upload page. Error messages are also shown if the credentials are incorrect

+ **Templates**
    The Template folder typically contains files that define the structure of this web app. 
    This includes the home, signup, login and addfile pages.

   * **/Index.html** 
    This file contains code that creates the structure and content of the homepage for the cloud storage service.
    It includes a hero section with a welcome message and buttons to sign up or log in. The features section highlights the benefits like fast uploads and unlimited storage. The pricing section displays different storage plans (Free, Pro, Business), and a testimonials section showing user feedback. Finally, the footer includes links to the Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and social media accounts.

    * **/addfile.html**
    This file contains code that enables users to upload files

+ **Css folder**
 This folder contains the styling code. 
 While the landing page features bright colors, the rest of the pages have a simple design.
